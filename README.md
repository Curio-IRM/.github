# Kleiner Perkins Fellows Program

Welcome to the repository for the Kleiner Perkins Fellows Program! This program is designed to provide undergraduate and graduate students with valuable opportunities in the fields of engineering, design, and product management. Please find below some important information about the program:

## About

The Kleiner Perkins Fellows Program offers exciting opportunities for students to gain experience and mentorship in various disciplines. Whether you're studying computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or fields related to software development, design, or business, there's a fellowship track for you.

## Who Can Apply?

- **Engineering Fellows**: Open to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at U.S. universities studying computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or related fields.
- **Design Fellows**: Open to students at U.S. universities from any academic discipline, with a focus on Visual, Interaction, or Web User Interface Design.
- **Product Fellows**: Open to outstanding undergraduate or graduate students graduating from a U.S. university with a degree related to engineering, design, or business, including graduate students in M.B.A. programs.

## Application Dates

Applications for the program open on Friday, November 18th, 2022, and close on Monday, January 9th, 2023, at 11:59 pm.

## Interview and Selection Process

After the review of all submitted applications by our technical, design, and product committee, a small number of students will be selected as semi-finalists. Semi-final interviews will be conducted virtually, and finalists will be chosen from there. Kleiner Perkins company partners will reach out to finalists and schedule interviews. If an offer is made, compensation and start/end dates will be negotiated directly between the student and the company. Accepted students will become Kleiner Perkins Fellows and will be invited to participate in all program activities.

## Company Selection and Nomination

Finalist candidates will have the opportunity to nominate the companies they would like their applications sent to. From that point on, the companies will reach out to schedule final interviews, allowing candidates to have a say in the selection process.

## Program Details

- **Compensation**: The Fellows Program offers competitive compensation, and the terms will be negotiated directly between the student and the employing portfolio company.
- **Program Duration**: The start and end dates of the program will be negotiated between the student and the startup. However, program-wide summer events will be held between mid-June to early August to accommodate the schedules of students from various universities.
- **Networking Opportunities**: While Fellows will be primarily working at one startup during the summer, the program is designed to provide ample opportunities to interact with people from other startups, as well as attend events hosted by Kleiner Perkins and startups within their portfolio.

## Multiple Program Applications

Applicants have the option to apply for more than one type of program. However, it is important to meet the eligibility guidelines for each program. Please note that applicants can only be accepted into one program.
