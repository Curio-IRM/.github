# Curio
> **Curio**: An intelligent relationship manager designed for the modern enterprise. Developed with love and expertise by our team members hailing from Figma, Neuron23, and Microsoft for the Kleiner Perkins hackathon.

## Why Curio?
Enterprises today are inundated with vast volumes of relationship data but are often ill-equipped to derive meaningful insights from them. This is where Curio shines. Going beyond a traditional CRM, Curio effortlessly eliminates the need for manual data entry, extraction, analysis, and updating, enabling you to explore your data through user-friendly SQL queries, no-code functionalities, and intuitive interfaces.

## What makes Curio stand out?
Curio is designed to provide you with three core features to help streamline your data management:

- 📊 **Curio Table:** Just upload your data source and let Curio do the rest. Our comprehensive data view combined with simple data query augmentation ensures your data fields are always up-to-date.

- 💬 **Curio Chat:** Want to dive deeper into your data? Use our interactive chat function to ask questions about your data in an easy Q&A format. But that's not all; Curio chat can also suggest actions like drafting emails, setting up calendar invites, or sending LinkedIn invites as you interact with it.

- 📌 **Curio Widgets:** Store key details in easy-to-access widgets and reduce the overhead of navigating through large volumes of data. Customized tasks at your fingertips!

These combined features serve every user, from the tech-savvy to the tech-averse, enabling anyone to generate insightful data.

## The Future of Curio
Our vision for Curio extends beyond today. We aim to be the premier intelligent manager for enterprises, venture capital companies, employers, and universities. Our goal is to intelligently manage relationships with employees, students, fellows, and more using cutting-edge technologies such as AI, large language models, and vector databases.

## We couldn't have done it alone!
A massive thank you to everyone who organized the hackathon. We want to give a special shoutout to our dedicated and hardworking team for turning this vision into reality.

🎉 Thank you, and welcome to the future with Curio! 🎉
