<h3 align="center">🚀 The Tomorrow We're Building Today 🚀</h3>

Using a simple spreadsheet of 250 past Kleiner Perkins Fellows, including their name, year, and LinkedIn URL, Curio auto-generates a cutting-edge intelligent database and chatbot providing in-depth analysis of these fellows.

<h3 align="center">✨ Case Study: Powering Insights with Kleiner Perkins Fellows ✨</h3>

Curio is envisioned to be the first port-of-call intelligent manager for enterprises, venture capital companies, employers, and universities. Our mission is to intelligently manage relationships with employees, students, fellows, and more, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies such as AI, large language models, and vector databases.

<h2 align="center">🤖 Technical Overview 🤖</h2>

Curio leverages a combination of advanced technologies to provide intelligent relationship management. 

1. **AI and Large Language Models**: Curio uses advanced AI and large language models for natural language processing and understanding. This enables the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

2. **Vector Database (Pinecone)**: Curio uses Pinecone, a vector database, to store high-dimensional vectors that represent complex data entities. This allows for efficient similarity search and retrieval of data, making Curio's responses more accurate and relevant.

3. **Retrieval Augmentation**: Curio enhances the retrieval process by using AI models to rank the retrieved documents based on relevance, providing the most appropriate responses to user queries.
