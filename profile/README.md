# Curio
Curio is an intelligent relationship manager developed for the Kleiner Perkins hackathon. Our tool is a no-code relationship data analysis solution designed specifically for enterprises. With the collective expertise of our team members from Figma, Neuron23, and Microsoft, we have managed to create a tool that simplifies your relationship data management.

## Overview
Often enterprises have large volumes of data but lack the tools to gain valuable insights. This is where Curio comes into the picture. Curio is not just another CRM. Our product eliminates the need for manual data entry, extraction, analysis, and updating. It also allows you to explore your data through SQL, queries, and no-code functionalities.

### Curio Features
Curio is designed to offer three primary functions:

1. **Curio Table:** A high-level data analysis tool. Upload your data source, and Curio will instantly create a comprehensive data view for you. Additionally, augment your tables with simple data queries, and Curio will auto-populate the data fields.

2. **Curio Chat:** A chat function that allows you to delve deeper into your data in an easy question-and-answer format. Curio chat also suggests actions like drafting emails, setting up calendar invites, sending LinkedIn invites, etc., as you interact with it. 

3. **Curio Widgets:** Extracted key details are stored in widgets, providing easy access and customized tasks. It reduces the overhead of navigating through large volumes of data.

The combination of these features serves every user, enabling anyone, irrespective of their technical expertise, to generate insight from data.

### Future Vision
Our future vision for Curio is to be the first intelligent manager for enterprises, venture capital companies, employers, and universities. Our goal is to manage their relationships with employees, students, fellows, etc., intelligently using AI, large language models, and vector databases.

### Acknowledgments
We want to extend our gratitude towards everyone who organized the hackathon. A special mention to our hardworking team for turning this vision into reality.

Thank you!
